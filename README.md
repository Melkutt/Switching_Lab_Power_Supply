Created with KiCad 5

It's a lab SMPS 0-24V and 0-3A, max out voltage can be "hard set" with 3 resistor if you want 5, 15 or 24 volt if you want to limit it.
Size 100x100 mm, 4 layers, mostly 0402 resistor and capacitor.
I have not come around to test it deaply yet, i will post more picture and logging the preformens later on!
